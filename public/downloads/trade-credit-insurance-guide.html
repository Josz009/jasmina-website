    <h1>Understanding Trade Credit Insurance</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A plain-language guide to protecting your accounts receivable</p>
  </div>

  <h2>What Is Trade Credit Insurance?</h2>
  <p>Trade credit insurance protects your business when your customers don't pay for goods or services you've already delivered. If you sell on credit terms (net 30, 60, or 90 days), you're essentially lending money to your customers. Trade credit insurance protects that "loan."</p>

  <p>If a customer becomes insolvent, declares bankruptcy, or simply doesn't pay within a defined period, your trade credit insurance policy reimburses you for a percentage of the loss — typically 80-90% of the invoice value.</p>

  <h2>Who Needs It?</h2>
  <p>You should consider trade credit insurance if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You sell goods or services on credit terms (net 30, 60, 90)</li>
    <li>A default by your top 3 customers would significantly impact your cash flow</li>
    <li>You're expanding into new markets or onboarding large new customers</li>
    <li>You operate in a cyclical or volatile industry</li>
    <li>You export to international markets</li>
    <li>You want to improve your borrowing capacity against receivables</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How It Works: Step by Step</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Application:</strong> You provide the insurer with information about your customers, annual sales, credit terms, and loss history.</li>
    <li><strong>Underwriting:</strong> The insurer evaluates your customer portfolio and assigns credit limits — the maximum insured amount for each customer.</li>
    <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> You sell and extend credit as normal. Your receivables are insured up to the approved limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> The insurer continuously monitors the financial health of your customers and may adjust limits.</li>
    <li><strong>Claims:</strong> If a customer defaults, you file a claim after the waiting period (typically 60-180 days past due). The insurer pays the agreed indemnification percentage.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Types of Coverage</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Coverage Type</th><th>What It Covers</th><th>Best For</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Whole Turnover</td><td>Your entire accounts receivable portfolio</td><td>Companies wanting comprehensive protection</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Key Accounts</td><td>Selected large or high-risk customers only</td><td>Companies with concentrated customer risk</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Single Buyer</td><td>One specific customer relationship</td><td>Companies with one dominant customer</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Export Credit</td><td>International receivables including political risk</td><td>Companies selling to overseas buyers</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>What's Covered vs. What's Not</h2>
  <div class="callout">
    <h3>Covered</h3>
    <p>Customer insolvency or bankruptcy. Protracted default (non-payment past a defined period). Political events preventing payment (export policies). Currency inconvertibility (export policies).</p>
  </div>

  <div class="callout">
    <h3>Not Covered</h3>
    <p>Contract disputes between you and the customer. Pre-existing bad debts. Customers you didn't submit for coverage. Sales that exceed the approved credit limit.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>The Cost</h2>
  <p>Trade credit insurance premiums are typically calculated as a percentage of your insured sales:</p>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Annual Insured Sales</th><th>Typical Premium Range</th><th>Annual Cost Example</th></tr>
    <tr><td>$1M - $5M</td><td>0.3% - 0.5%</td><td>$3,000 - $25,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$5M - $25M</td><td>0.2% - 0.4%</td><td>$10,000 - $100,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$25M - $100M</td><td>0.1% - 0.3%</td><td>$25,000 - $300,000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$100M+</td><td>0.05% - 0.2%</td><td>$50,000+</td></tr>
  </table>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> Actual premiums vary based on your industry, customer portfolio quality, loss history, and coverage structure. These ranges are illustrative only.
  </div>

  <h2>Hidden Benefits Beyond Protection</h2>
  <h3>1. Better Financing</h3>
  <p>Banks advance more against insured receivables — often 85-90% vs. 70-80% for uninsured. This improves your working capital and borrowing capacity immediately.</p>

  <h3>2. Market Intelligence</h3>
  <p>Insurers have vast databases on business financial health. Credit limit changes serve as an early warning system about your customers' financial stability.</p>

  <h3>3. Sales Growth</h3>
  <p>With downside protection, you can confidently offer competitive credit terms to new customers and expand into new markets without fear of catastrophic loss.</p>

  <h3>4. Professional Credit Management</h3>
  <p>The insurer's underwriting process essentially provides you with a professional credit team evaluating your customer portfolio — expertise that would cost far more to build in-house.</p>

  <h2>Major Providers</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Provider</th><th>Headquarters</th><th>Specialty</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Allianz Trade (formerly Euler Hermes)</td><td>Paris, France</td><td>Largest global provider, all sizes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Coface</td><td>Paris, France</td><td>Strong in emerging markets</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Atradius</td><td>Amsterdam, Netherlands</td><td>Strong in mid-market</td></tr>
    <tr><td>AIG</td><td>New York, USA</td><td>Large, complex programs</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Zurich</td><td>Zurich, Switzerland</td><td>Integrated with other coverages</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Getting Started: Your Action Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Assess your exposure:</strong> List your top 10 customers and the maximum receivable from each. What would happen if your largest customer didn't pay?</li>
    <li><strong>Gather your data:</strong> Insurers will need your customer list, annual sales by customer, credit terms, and any historical bad debt losses.</li>
    <li><strong>Get quotes:</strong> Approach 2-3 providers or work with a specialty broker. Compare not just price, but credit limits, waiting periods, and indemnification percentages.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate the ROI:</strong> Factor in not just the protection, but improved financing terms and the market intelligence value.</li>
  </ol>
