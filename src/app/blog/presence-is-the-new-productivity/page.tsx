        In today&apos;s business world, we are living through a quiet epidemic. Digital technology and globalization have erased the boundaries between work and life. The office is in our pockets, at our kitchen tables, and in our bedrooms. The 24/7 culture has sold us a powerful myth: being always on means being successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Busyness has become a badge of honor. Long hours and packed schedules are socially rewarded. In many industries, exhaustion is glorified as commitment. This is one of the hidden symptoms of modern capitalism, where productivity is often valued more than presence, and speed more than meaning.

      <h2>The Cost of Constant Motion</h2>
      <p>
        But constant motion comes at a cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we operate in a state of nonstop urgency, we disconnect from ourselves. Well-being declines. Self-worth becomes tied to output. Creativity narrows. Performance degrades. Interactions become tense and transactional. We may look productive, yet feel increasingly inefficient and disconnected from purpose.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Being busy is not the same as being effective. Time in does not equal meaningful output.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Space Creates Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Over the years, I have learned that real impact requires space. Space to think. Space to feel. Space to question why we are doing what we are doing. Without that pause, we risk losing sight of where we are headed and, more importantly, why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Success is not built on exhaustion. It is built on clarity, alignment, and intentional action.
