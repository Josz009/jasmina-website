      <p>
        Greed is more than a personal flaw — it&apos;s a shadow energy that can ripple through organizations, industries, and communities. When unchecked, it drives the insatiable desire for power, influence, recognition, or success, often at the expense of integrity, collaboration, and sustainable growth.

      <h2>When Individual Shadow Becomes Collective Pattern</h2>
      <p>
        In business, individual shadow patterns become collective patterns. Teams and organizations mirror the behaviors of those who operate from fear or scarcity, normalizing competition, compromise, and short-term thinking. What starts as personal ambition can turn into systemic imbalance.
      </p>

      <h2>The Antidote: Conscious Self-Awareness</h2>
      <p>
        The antidote is conscious self-awareness. By recognizing and working with our shadow, we can transform greed into aspiration — a mindful drive for growth, purpose, and contribution. Aligning ambition with values creates empowered individuals, ethical organizations, and cultures that thrive sustainably.
      </p>

      <h2>Transformation Begins Within</h2>
      <p>
        Transformation begins with the individual, but its effects are collective. Conscious leaders shape not only their businesses but also the systems and communities they touch. Ambition guided by awareness is not just productive — it is regenerative.
