      <p>
        In my 20+ years working in trade credit insurance at AIG, I&apos;ve watched businesses of all sizes face the same devastating scenario: a major customer defaults on payment, and suddenly the company&apos;s cash flow, profitability, and even survival are at risk. The painful irony? There&apos;s an entire category of insurance designed to prevent exactly this — and most business owners have never heard of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me change that.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Trade Credit Insurance?</h2>
      <p>
        Trade credit insurance (also called accounts receivable insurance or credit insurance) protects your business when customers don&apos;t pay for the goods or services you&apos;ve delivered. If you sell on credit terms — meaning you deliver first and get paid later, which is how most B2B transactions work — you&apos;re extending credit to your customers. And that credit comes with risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trade credit insurance covers that risk. If a customer becomes insolvent, declares bankruptcy, or simply refuses to pay (known as protracted default), your insurance policy pays you a percentage of the outstanding receivable — typically 80-90% of the invoice value.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Most Businesses Don&apos;t Know About It</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike property insurance or liability insurance, trade credit insurance isn&apos;t something most insurance brokers proactively discuss. It&apos;s a specialty product, typically offered by a handful of global insurers — AIG, Euler Hermes (now Allianz Trade), Coface, and Atradius being the major players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many business owners don&apos;t realize they need it until it&apos;s too late. They think:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>&quot;My customers always pay&quot;</strong> — Until the day they don&apos;t. Even long-standing customers can face sudden financial difficulties.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;I do credit checks&quot;</strong> — Credit checks tell you about the past. They don&apos;t predict the future.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;I can&apos;t afford another insurance premium&quot;</strong> — The typical cost is 0.1-0.5% of insured sales. Compare that to losing 100% of a major receivable.</li>
        <li><strong>&quot;That&apos;s only for big companies&quot;</strong> — Policies are available for businesses of all sizes, including SMBs with annual revenues under $5 million.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How It Actually Works</h2>
      <h3>The Policy Structure</h3>
      <p>
        A typical trade credit insurance policy covers your entire accounts receivable portfolio — or a selected portion of it. Here&apos;s how the process works:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> You apply for coverage and provide information about your customers, sales volumes, and credit terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> The insurer evaluates your customer portfolio and assigns credit limits for each buyer — the maximum amount they&apos;ll insure for each customer.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> You sell and extend credit to your customers as normal. If a customer defaults, you file a claim.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> After a waiting period (typically 60-180 days from the due date), the insurer pays your claim at the agreed indemnification percentage.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What&apos;s Covered</h3>
      <p>
        Most policies cover two types of risk:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Commercial risk:</strong> Customer insolvency, bankruptcy, or protracted default (non-payment past a defined period).</li>
        <li><strong>Political risk:</strong> For exporters — government actions, currency inconvertibility, or political events that prevent payment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What&apos;s Not Covered</h3>
      <p>
        Trade credit insurance doesn&apos;t cover disputes. If your customer refuses to pay because they claim the product was defective or the service wasn&apos;t delivered as promised, that&apos;s not a credit loss — that&apos;s a contract dispute. The distinction matters.
      </p>

      <h2>The Hidden Benefits Beyond Protection</h2>
      <p>
        In my experience, the direct insurance protection is actually just one of several benefits. Here&apos;s what most people don&apos;t realize:
      </p>

      <h3>1. Better Financing Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Banks love insured receivables. When your accounts receivable are protected by trade credit insurance, lenders are often willing to advance a higher percentage against those receivables and at better rates. I&apos;ve seen clients reduce their borrowing costs significantly simply by adding a trade credit policy.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Market Intelligence</h3>
      <p>
        Trade credit insurers have vast databases on business financial health. When they decline to cover a particular customer or reduce a credit limit, that&apos;s valuable intelligence. It&apos;s an early warning system that can alert you to customer financial difficulties before they become your problem.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Confident Growth</h3>
      <p>
        Many businesses limit their growth because they&apos;re afraid to extend large credit lines to new customers. Trade credit insurance removes that fear. You can offer competitive credit terms to new customers, enter new markets, and scale your sales — knowing that the downside is protected.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>The best time to buy trade credit insurance is before you need it. The worst time is after your biggest customer has already stopped paying.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Real Numbers: The Cost-Benefit Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Let me walk through a simplified example. Say your business has $10 million in annual credit sales:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual premium:</strong> Approximately $20,000-$50,000 (0.2-0.5% of insured sales)</li>
        <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> 90% of insured receivables</li>
        <li><strong>If your largest customer ($2M in annual sales) defaults:</strong> You recover $1.8 million instead of losing $2 million</li>
        <li><strong>Net benefit:</strong> $1.75-1.78 million saved, minus years of premiums</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even if you never file a claim, the improved financing terms and market intelligence often pay for the premium on their own. And when you do need it, the ROI is astronomical.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Should Consider Trade Credit Insurance?</h2>
      <p>
        You should seriously evaluate trade credit insurance if:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You sell on credit terms (net 30, 60, 90 days)</li>
        <li>A default by your top 3 customers would significantly impact your business</li>
        <li>You&apos;re expanding into new markets or taking on larger customers</li>
        <li>Your industry has inherent volatility or is cyclical</li>
        <li>You export to international markets</li>
        <li>You want to improve your borrowing capacity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>
        After two decades in this industry, I&apos;ve seen trade credit insurance save businesses that would otherwise have failed, enable growth that would otherwise have been too risky, and provide peace of mind that no amount of internal credit management can match.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&apos;s not the right product for every business. But it&apos;s the right product for far more businesses than currently use it. If you&apos;re extending credit to customers and you&apos;ve never explored trade credit insurance, you owe it to yourself to at least understand what you&apos;re leaving on the table.
      </p>
